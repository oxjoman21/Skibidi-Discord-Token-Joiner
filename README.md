# Skibidi Discord Token Joiner  
A **powerful**, completely **free** Discord Token Joiner â€“ Unflagged, Solver Supported, and **always up-to-date**! ðŸš€  

---

## Why this Repo?  
Way too many people sell joiners or boosters for ridiculous prices. So I thought: **why not make one for free?** Now everyone can use it without paying a cent!  

If youâ€™re looking for a **better, safer, and unflagged** solution, I recommend checking out **[NexusTools](https://nexustools.de/)**. They offer top-quality joiners with full source code, lifetime updates, and soon a more reliable solvers.

> **Heads Up:** The solver included here **isnâ€™t mine**. I just added it for convenience, but if your tokens get locked or flagged, thatâ€™s on you. I have **no partnerships** with anyone, and this solver is just as-is. Use at your own risk.

## Installation  
1. Install **Python 3.x** (get the latest version).  
2. Download this repo.  
3. Add your tokens to `input/tokens.txt`.  
4. (Optional) Add your proxies to `input/proxies.txt` â€“ needed if youâ€™re using the solver.
